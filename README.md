- Hey guys, for everyone that has a problem with starting the Expo app on your mobile, simply run the command 

Try:
# npm start (it worked last time for emulator)

# npx expo start --tunnel (didn't work anymore)

and it should work. Good luck :)

If it runs with 

# sudo npx expo start --tunnel 

it will search for another place as root and will not work
